We have cloned a e-commarce application called Razer. It simply meant allowing to buy customers electronics devices. Over time it has evolved to provide multiple benefits on one platform for all razer needs.

In this Project, We have tried to implement some of the functionalities of the application like filtering the restaurants based on cuisine, offers, and the facilities available with them along with these we have tried sorting functionalities and the User flow of booking a table and applying best available offers at a restaurant.
